## Why GraphQL? Why Apollo Server?

Apollo Server is the best way to build a production ready GraphQL server. It is designed from day one to make it easy to connect data from your backend(s) to a well designed schema ready for clients to use! Apollo Server is designed to work with every major Node HTTP servers such as Express, Hapi, and Koa, as well as serverless environments like AWS Lambda.

Apollo Server supports the entire GraphQL Spec and can be queried from any GraphQL client. It's:


1.  **Incrementally adoptable**, so you can drop it into an existing app today.
2.  **Universally compatible**, so it works with any build setup, any GraphQL client, and any data source.
3.  **Simple to get started with**, so you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.
4.  **Production ready**, so you don't have to change what you do to go live.
5.  **Community driven**, because it is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases.

These docs will help you go from getting started with Apollo to becoming an expert in no time!

## Productive GraphQL Development

Apollo Server, and the rest of the Apollo ecosystem, give you a powerful set of tools to rapidly stand up a GraphQL API on top of your existing, or new, backends. It does this by focusing on a schema-first approach where you build your schema with a concise, declarative syntax, and fill in the logic with data fetching resolver functions. It is easy to get started with [one-step mocking]() while you fill out your data and build your UI. With powerful tools like [schema directives](./schemas/directives.html), [tracing and cache control](./best-practices/caching.html), and [schema stitching](), you can build the service of your dreams without writing a line of code more than you need.
